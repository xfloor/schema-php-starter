# Schema Starter Template (PHP)

This template will help you get started building ecommerce with Schema. Use it as a learning tool, as a basis for a custom ecommerce application, or break it apart and take the pieces you need into an existing project.

For more information on how to use the Schema API, visit https://schema.io/docs.

## Setup

1) Upload the source to any basic PHP-enabled directory.

- If you're running Apache, the included `.htaccess` file will enable clean URLs.
- Make the `cache` folder writable by the web server

2) Edit config.php with your Schema API credentials

```php
<?php // config.php

$config['client_id'] = 'client-id';

$config['client_key'] = 'secret-key';
```

That's it! Visit the home page and complete the setup steps provided (if applicable).
